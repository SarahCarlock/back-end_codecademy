cURL CLI arguments
Here are a few cURL argument we'll pass with our requests. All requests will simply be curl followed by the argument and data to pass.

curl
-X --request - Custom request method
-d --data - Sends the specified data
-H --header - Sends headers
-i --include - Display response headers

GET retrieves data.
POST creates a new resource. It is non-idempotent, meaning that two identical POST requests will create two new resources.
PUT updates an existing resource. It is idempotent, meaning that two identical PUT requests will modify the same resource. A PUT request requires the entire body to be sent through; if any data is missing, that data will be wiped (except automatic values like auto-incrementing IDs and timestamps).
PATCH updates an existing resource, and does not require sending the entire body with the request.
DELETE removes a resource.
