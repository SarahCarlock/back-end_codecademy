Outside-in test-driven development doesnâ€™t answer these questions, but provides you with an approach to finding an answer. 
    It helps you avoid the decision paralysis that often slows development teams, leads to extended deadlines, and incomplete implementation.
    In addition to the efficiencies discussed above, the outside-in approach is a satisfying way to develop a web application with a full test suite.
Test-driven development (TDD): the process of writing tests before implementation code.
    Red, Green, Refactor Cycle: common approach.
Oustide-in TD: developers use to bui;d full-stack web apps. Uses Reg, Green, Refactor Cycle, but a failing test does not always inform you to write new implementation code.
